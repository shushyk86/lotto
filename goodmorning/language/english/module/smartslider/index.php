<li>Just press the \'Import sample sliders\' button at the top of the page and it will create a copy of these sample sliders for you. You can play with these sliders, don\'t worry about breaking them, it is meant to be for testing and experimenting. </li>
<li>If you ever want to revert them to their original state, just press the \'Import sample sliders\' button again and it will create you a second, untouched copy from each of them.</li> 
<li>Please note that the \'Sample slider\' is a full, well designed, complex slider. If you are not yet familiar with the settings, we recommend you to check an other sample slider first.</li>
